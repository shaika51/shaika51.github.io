## Overview

This project involved designing and deploying a professional profile website using front-end web technologies. The goal was to showcase resume content while integrating hands-on JavaScript features and third-party APIs. The website is deployed using GitHub Pages and fulfills both aesthetic and functional criteria including clocks, cookies, email toggles, and external APIs like weather, jokes, and comics.

Through this project, I strengthened my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML/CSS, API integration, and deployment using GitHub. I also practiced secure coding techniques covered in the course.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Web Application Programming and Hacking (WAPH) course taught by Dr. Phu Phung. The objective was to create a professional portfolio website using front-end web technologies and deploy it on GitHub Pages. The website showcases resume content such as education, skills, and projects, and integrates dynamic features and public APIs.

The project helped strengthen practical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API integration, and cookie-based user tracking. A secondary page (waph.html) introduces the WAPH course and related technical content. The completed website is fully responsive, visually styled using Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS, and meets all the project requirements.
